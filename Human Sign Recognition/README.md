In this  we will classify the sign language symbols using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After successful training of the CNN model, the corresponding alphabet of a sign language symbol will be predicted. We will evaluate the classification performance of our model using the non-normalized and normalized confusion matrices. Finally, we will obtain the classification accuracy score of the CNN model in this task
